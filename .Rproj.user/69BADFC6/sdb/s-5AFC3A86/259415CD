Our survival depends on it. Given the rapid speed at which we encounter information and to which we must react, humans have developed fine grained mechanisms to quickly sift through large quantities of information to pick what is of interest. And it naturally involves making relatively quick judgments about quality.  \n\nOne fairly general model of how people choose what information to consume is as follows: people act on their preferences based on the information available to them in a manner that maximizes their utility. \n\nPreferences differ between people, but also by circumstance and by whim. While there is little doubt that superficially apolitical information bears on people's political attitudes, we mostly focus on preferences for consuming information manifestly related to politics or from sources known for carrying political information. The most prominent of such preferences is whether people choose to read about public affairs, broadly construed. While no firm tallies exist, most people most of the time choose not to consume public affairs programming. News affairs programming, as best as we can measure it, constitutes a tiny proportion of most people's `media diet.' Most of the variation in news media diet is between 0 and 5\\% of the media consumption. This isn't to say that variation isn't important. Our guess is that it is hugely so \\citep{luskin2011}. \n\nWithin political affairs programming, there is a broad set of preferences for the kind of programming, the mode in which it is delivered, the style, and the topic. Some people prefer to learn about particular issues \\citep[see for e.g.,][]{Iyengar2008}. Older people, for instance, may be more liable to read news about Medicare. Immigrants news about their home country. There are more widely shared preferences -- one is for negative information \\citep{trussler2014}, another for accurate information,  another for important information -- information considered important by elites or peers. Then there are preferences for style, soft over hard. Or satire over hard news. For instance, The Daily Show over News Tonight. And format -- video over text. And perhaps even thematic versus episodic coverage. And lastly, preference for congenial information. In particular, partisan congenial information.\n\nConstraining ourselves to decisions about consuming political information, preferences that may contribute a great deal to the utility may be: interest in politics, interest in consuming something ideologically congenial, and interest in getting accurate information. This isn't an exhaustive inventory but one that stocks primary concerns for many, if not most, people.   Our list covers a great deal of territory in one other important way -- it covers information that people typically have about what they are about to consume, increasingly so. Then there are a whole set of conditioning variables. Contextual cues may up the importance of some information and even some preferences. Contextual circumstance may change preference structure.  \n\nGiven focus in previous research, we discuss two kinds of preferences in greater detail: Preference for entertainment, and partisan congenial information. But before we do, we would like to take a moment to clarify the difference between preferences and consumption. There is often a sizable difference between our ideal point and the ideal point of what we consume. There are a variety of reasons for the disjuncture. For one, sometimes what we want isn't on the menu. For two, to actuate our preferences, we often rely on easily available information. For instance, in case of media, we often rely on source cues. For three, we are only boundedly rational. For instance, as Martin and Yurukoglu show, channel position affect what we consume \\citep{Martin2014}.  \n\n\\section*{A Preference for Entertainment}\n\nTo acquire political knowledge one must have the opportunity to be exposed to political information, the motivation to consume political information when given the opportunity, and have the ability to organize and process this information \\citep[p. 335][]{luskin1990}. So the differences in individual levels of political knowledge emerge from differences in ``demand'' (means and motives), and ``supply'' (opportunity). Motivation or interest itself depends on perceived usefulness of information to self and perceived utility of the information to the individual's social milieu, with latter hypothesized to be more salient than former \\citep{genova1979interests}.\n\nTill a quarter a century or so ago, during times of the day when many people were at home and seated in front of their television, news exposure was often inadvertant. Rather than turn off the television to wait for the next sitcom, people would sit through the news. Although a captive news audience does not exhibit the same political interest as a self-selected one and therefore may not learn as much, research on passive learning \\citep{krugman1970} suggests that even unmotivated exposure can produce learning \\citep{keeter1986, zukin1984}. According to Graber, ``people who are exposed to large amounts of news will remember many stories despite lack of interest because mere exposure produces learning'' \\citep[pg. 114][]{graber1998}.\n\nPrevious research has shown that some people prefer hard news over soft news -- with those more interested in politics choosing hard news more often than those less interested in politics \\citep{prior2007post}. These asymmetries in motivation have likely exacerbated the knowledge gaps first identified by \\citep[pgs 159-60][]{tichenor1970}.\n\nAs is perhaps clear, exposure to media should only affect asymmetry in ``current affairs knowledge'' (for a discussion about normative importance of surveillance knowledge -- \\citep[see][]{graber2004mediated, leighley2003mass, lupia1998, schudson1998good, zaller2003new} and not civic knowledge.\n\n\\section*{Preference for Congenial Political Information}\n\nSelective exposure to congenial political information is often thought to be driven by either a motivation to be accurate or a motivation to avoid dissonant information. Untangling the effects of these motivations on media consumption is fairly difficult, as dissonance causing information is also perceived to be more accurate. In the classical study on ``attitude polarization'', Lord, Ross, and Lepper (1979) found that people tend to find that academic work that coincides with their prior attitudes as more credible than that which conflicts with their prior attitudes. Therefore, it is difficult to interpret the motivation underpinning results such \\citet{Iyengar2009a}, where  Republicans choose a news story from Fox News Channel more often than any other channel.  \n\nTo parse out whether the selection is driven by congeniality or by perceived accuracy, one needs a measure of ideological distance between one's own ideal points and the ideal points of an outlet and a measure of perceived accuracy.  One can then regress choice on ideological distance and perceived accuracy to assess how much each contribute to why people select. Of course, both perceived accuracy and perceived ideological distance may be endogenous, but that is immaterial for perceptions are the causal quantities of interest. It is also possible that the choice one makes is also endogenous to ideological distance and perceived accuracy but we find   XXXX????\n\n[FIGURE ON BELIEVABILITY??]\n\n\nAnother way of getting at whether the selection is ideological than say driven by trust, we can break that correlation by focusing on stories rather than sources. Trust and accuracy really apply to a source and not to a story. So by manipulating the congeniality of a story, while keeping news source constant, we can get at the degree to which selectivity is ideological.  \n\nThe other contribution is that some people choose to watch channels that they don’t think are most accurate. This has implications for what we think the result of exposure will be on their attitudes. One possibility is that they underweight what the channels say etc. This may predict partisan knowledge gaps and partisan animus.\n\nSo has increased access to partisan media carrying soft and hard news led partisans to seek out information primarily from like-minded sources?  It depends on one's evidence. Based on self-reported news consumption and studies wherein researchers randomly assign sources to headlines, partisans clearly prefer congenial information. REAL DATA. \n\n\n\nStudies tracking news exposure have uncovered only slight traces of partisan selectivity.  Nielsen ratings show considerable overlap between the audience for Fox and other cable outlets \\citep{Prior2012}.  Aggregate-level studies of website traffic also show that while people visit sites on both sides of the partisan divide, most people get their news from neutral sources. Selective exposure to online news sources, although modest, appears to exceed selective exposure on cable and broadcast media \\citep{Gentzkow2011b}. \n\n\\subsection*{Hetereogeneity in Preference for Congenial Political Information}\nHowever such aggregate-level metrics hide considerable variation.  For instance, partisan bloggers rarely link to the other side \\citep{adamic2005, hindman2008}.  Survey evidence on the make-up of readers of these partisan blogs is also unequivocal; virtually the entire audience for particular partisan blogs is made up of individuals with the same political preferences as the source \\citep{lawrence2010}.  Thus, the audience for political blogs provides the exemplary instance of partisan selectivity; ``blog readers appear highly polarized relative to non-blog readers and other news consumers, and are very nearly as polarized as U.S. Senators'' \\citep[p. 141,][]{lawrence2010}. \n\nGiven that readers of partisan blogs are more likely to be strong partisans, it is no surprise that strength of partisanship is correlated with partisan selectivity \\citep{Garrett2009, Iyengar2009a}. Some research also finds that preference for congenial sources is greater among Republicans than Democrats \\citep{Garrett2009, Iyengar2009a}. Though other competing explanations exist. For one, the signal of Fox is taken as interchangeable to MSNBC. It very likely isn't. At least among Democrats, preference for congenial sources may co-exist with preference for uncongenial sources \\citep{Garrett2009}. Lastly, among Republicans, the preference for consuming information from partisan sources applies to both hard and soft news \\citep{Iyengar2009a}.\n\nSome evidence corroborates the rough template of selection that we have laid out above. For instance, the politically disinterested sometimes choose to opt out of news \\citep{prior2007post, bennett2008new}.  Of course, that may be no escape from partisan news. Partisan cable channels are no slouches in the hustle for the market share. Fox, for instance, has established a niche for sports coverage, MSNBC specializes in late-night crime programming, and Huffington Post is one of the major sources for coverage of Hollywood and celebrity life.  This gives particular teeth to a study that shows that not only are Republicans/conservatives attracted to Fox reports bearing on public affairs, but they also turned to Fox for information about sports and travel destinations suggesting that source cues are uniformly influential across subject matter domains \\citep{Iyengar2009a}.\n\n\\section*{Measurement}\n\nWhile the measurments we need to measure partisan media exposure have made strides in recent years, there are, of course, a number of ways in which they can still be improved\n\nIdeally, we would like to track all information consumption, precisely measure ideology of each unit of information, and, on the same scale as ideology of information, the ideology of the consumer. We could then look at the amount of, and the distribution of the ideology of the information consumed. If we so wanted, we could also summarize various moments of the distribution of ideological distances for each person. And if we were worried about dimensionality, we would do the same by issue area. But such granular data are hard if not impossible to get. \n\nGiven limitations, scholars have made a host of simplifying assumptions about each component of the measure. For a more systematic look, we deal with assumptions about measurement of ideology, and consumption independently. \n\n\\subsection*{Measures of Ideology}\nThere are three aspects to measurement of ideology: granularity of the information about which judgments are made, how the judgments are made, and the precision of those judgments. %%YL: I don't understand, can you elaborate.\n\nThe modal study on selective exposure makes judgment about ideology at the level of an outlet takes ideology of various information sources as self-evident, and makes categorical (often trichotomous) ideological judgments. For instance, MSNBC and the New York Times are lumped together as left wing; Fox News and the Wall Street Journal on the Right; and ABC, NBC, and CNN in the middle. Information is then defined as either congenial or uncongenial, with congeniality defined as when the ideological category of the person and the information match. (See for instance \\citealt{Iyengar2009a, stroud2010polarization, levendusypolcomm2013, Garrett2009}.) \n\nThese decisions all entail incurring some error. First, making judgments at the level of outlet means resorting to ecological inference. Evidence suggests that outlets are not monoliths and generally carry a variety of ideological perspectives \\citep{barbera2014}. Second, skipping measurement of ideology opens researchers to attacks of subjectivity: To many, the New York Times and NPR are far-left outlets, to others, they are moderate and objective. Third, categorical measures of ideology lose potentially vital information. For a Republican at a 6 on a 1 to 7 liberal to conservative scale, consuming a bit of information at 5 is taken as same as consuming a bit of information at 7.\n\nA second more sophisticated way of measuring the ideology of an outlet utilizes SOMETHING ABOUT ITEM RESPONSE THEORY AND ITS PROBLEMS. \n\n\\subsection*{Measures of Consumption}\n\nConsumption is either measured via passive tracking of information consumption or survey measures. We deal with each one independently.\n\n\\subsubsection*{Browsing Data}\nRather than track all information, people limit themselves to measuring just political information. This means ignoring consumption of \\textit{American Dad}, \\textit{Will and Grace}, \\textit{Law and Order}, among other shows. It is likely that entertainment shows affect political attitudes on salient topics, and ignoring them is unwarranted. If we limit ourselves to political information, it isn't clear what the domain of political information is. The domain is likely vast, and increasing by the minute. After all, we are all producers of political information. When using rich browsing data, scholars often rely on ad hoc lists of domains to estimate consumption of certain kind of media. A prototypical example: \n\n\\begin{quote}\nWe select an initial universe of news outlets (i.e., web domains) via the Open Directory Project (ODP, dmoz.org), a collective of tens of thousands of editors who hand-label websites into a classification hierarchy. This gives 7,923 distinct domains labeled as: news, politics/news, politics/media, and regional/news. Since the vast majority of these news sites receive relatively little traffic, to simplify our analysis we restrict to the one hundred domains that attracted the largest number of unique visitors from our sample of toolbar users. This list of popular news sites includes every major national news source, well-known blogs and many regional dailies, and collectively accounts for over 98\\% of page views of news sites in the full ODP list (as estimated via our toolbar sample) \\citep{Flaxman2015}\n\\end{quote}\n\nUsing these lists to estimate consumption raises three obvious concerns – 1) Even sites classified as news sites, such as the NYT, carry a fair bit of non-news 2) (speaking categorically) There is the danger of false positives 3) And (speaking categorically again) there is a danger of false negatives.\n\nWe can address the first concern by exploiting the URL structure. For instance, \\citealt{Flaxman2015} exploit the fact that the URL of NY Times stories contains information about the section. They assume the classifier to be perfect. But likely isn't. False positive and negative rates for this kind of classification can be estimated using raw article data. \n\nThis leaves us with concern about false positives and negatives at the domain level. Lists like those published by DMOZ appear to be curated well-enough to not contain too many false-positives. The real question is about how to calibrate false negatives. Here's one proposal. Take a large random sample of the browsing data. Compare it to a large comprehensive database like Shallalist. Of the domains that aren't in the database, query a URL classification service such as Trusted Source. (The initial step of comparing against Shallalist is to reduce the amount of querying.) Using the results, estimate the proportion of missing domain names (the net number of missing domain names is likely much much larger). Also estimate missed visitation time, page views etc.\n\n\\subsubsection*{Survey Data}\nOn surveys, concerns about granularity and adequately capturing the domain of political information are greatly exacerbated. No one expects people to wade through really long lists of information sources and accurately report their usage. The corollary to the previous proposition is that trusting users to keep a diary that accurately records information about their media consumption is a reverie only Nielsen is happy to engage in.  \n\nHence, most survey measures of media consumption carry only a small number of salient options. To generalize from measures with sharply curtailed denominator, one must assume that no sampling bias in the choice of the domain. The skew towards salient news sources in most survey media consumption batteries can yield biased measures if people are more (or less) selective about less mainstream political sources. In fact, one can easily conjure up such a scenario -- people go to mainstream news sources to get the information and to more idiosyncratic sites carrying sympathetic interpretation for opinion about the facts. \n\nThe bigger problem with survey batteries of media measures is that their composition doesn't reflect the choice domain. For instance, \\citet{Iyengar2009a} present the respondent with a media battery with equal proportions of `conservative,' `liberal' and `neutral' news sources. The true composition of the domain may be closer to a bulk of information choices in or near the center, and only a few outlets with explicit `liberal' or `conservative' points of view. To infer choices in real life, the truncated choice condition still needs to be true to the composition of the domain. Inferences from such curtailed and biased domain experiments can at best recover ordinal rankings -- person X prefers conservative outlets more than person Y. \n\nThe other notable problem with survey measures is expressive responding \\citep{prior2013}. Republicans may report that they watch Fox News not because they do but because they want to convey they consume news that think is consistent with their self-identity. Similarly, Democrats may be especially averse to acknowledging that they consume Fox News.\n\nLastly, rather than use survey reports, some scholars have tried to impute preferences based on a small number of choice trials \\citep[see][]{Iyengar2009a}.\nThe choice experiments keep the news stories the same but change the news source and via behavior, impute preferences for the outlet. This `behavioral' measure suffer from all the same problems as conventional survey problems -- small biased choice sets -- but in addition, because of a small number of trials, the measure also tends to be very unreliable. (YPH -WE SHOULD MAKE THE POINT ABOUT LOW RELIABILITY OF MEASURES FROM THESE EXPERIMENTS PRETTY CLEAR WITH OUR YG DATA.) \n\n\\subsubsection*{Data and Research Design}\nWe designed an experiment to gauge preference for partisan congenial news sources in a realistic online setting.  By randomly assigning a set of identical news stories -- both hard and soft -- to different sources, and allowing participants to select the story they were most inclined to read, we obtained behavioral measures -- as opposed to self-reports -- of preference for partisan congenial sources.  We separately determined preference for partisan sources in the areas of hard and soft news.  Given the apolitical content of soft news stories, we anticipated that partisans would show weaker preference for partisan news sources when selecting soft news.  Our results suggest otherwise.  \n\nParticipants (N=2000, recruited from the YouGov web panel) were told that the investigators were developing a new way of displaying online news, and that they were to select one story to read from a set of six stories displayed on their computer screen. The screen layout followed the format of Google News, and a Google News logo appeared in the upper left corner (see Appendix A for screenshots of the layout).   Story headlines and associated source images were displayed in two rows, each with three headlines; we randomized the position of individual stories within each screen.  Participants completed four rounds of the source selection task. \n\nThe full set of 24 stories (4 screens each with six stories) included an equal number of hard and entertainment news reports.   The former included stories on electoral politics and the economy.  Entertainment news stories focused on celebrity life, sports, movies, and sleep disorders.  A source logo was randomly assigned to each story.  The first and third trial provided logos corresponding to news organizations, e.g., Fox News.  The second and fourth trials matched stories with both a television network and a prominent news personality from the network, e.g., The O'Reilly Factor (Fox).   All four trials featured two left-leaning sources, two right-leaning sources, and two non-partisan sources. \n\nFollowing the four news selection screens, respondents were asked to select a short video sound bite from major political figures.  The objectives underlying the video selection task were first, to assess the overlap in selectivity between news sources and campaign advertising; and second, to investigate whether people who preferred to obtain their news from partisan sources also preferred to listen to their own party's candidates engage in attack-oriented rather than promotional rhetoric.  \n\nThere were two video selection screens.  Each screen featured one prominent Democrat and one prominent Republican making either a positive or negative appeal.  For example, respondents could select between two Romney clips, one titled ``I'll get America working again'' and another titled ``We have zero faith in our President.''  While the first screen presented clips from Obama and Romney, the second screen included clips from Nancy Pelosi and Michele Bachman. The order of videos within each of the two screens was randomized.\n\n\\subsection*{Impact of Problems}    \nCoding ideology at the level of outlet-- New York Times is independent (or liberal) and Fox simply conservative -- or coding ideology continuously at a more granular but crude level of program for television but outlet for newspaper -- means coding all bits of information consumed from a source as the same. This is called ecological inference. And there are some attendant risks. We know that not all NYT articles are liberal. In fact, we know much of it is not even political news. A toy example of how such measures can mislead:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Page Views: 10 Fox, 10 CNN. Est:} \\frac{10}{20}\\\\\n\\text{But say Fox Pages 7R, 3D and CNN 5R, 5D}\\\\\n\\text{Est:} \\frac{7}{10} + \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{12}{20}\n\\end{align*}\n\nIf the measure of ideology is continuous, there are still some risks. If we code all page views as mean ideology of the source, we assume that the person views a random sample of pages on the source. (Or some version of that.) But that is too implausible an assumption. It is much more likely that a liberal reading the NYT likely stays away from the David Brooks' columns. If you account for such within source self-selection, selective exposure measures based on source level coding are going to be downwardly biased -- that is find people as less selective than they are.\n\nThe conventional estimand -- as best as we can gather -- is $\\frac{\\text{Bits of politically congenial information consumed}}{\\text{All political information}}$. As a result of \\citealt{Garrett2009}, another corresponding ratio was added: $\\frac{\\text{Bits of uncongenial information}}{\\text{All political information consumed}}$. To estimand makes the \n\n multiple simplying assumptions. First, the ideology is measured categorically and  \n\nthen is a set of two ratios:  Other reasonable formalizations exist, including difference between congenial and uncongenial. (Note that the denominator is absent, and reasonably so.)\n\n\\section*{Consequences of Selective Exposure}\nOur hunch is that exposure to partisan media causes people to hold ill-will towards the other party. This expectation is driven by research that shows that partisan sources not only cover events and issues that favor their party, but their messages also feature considerable aversion for the out-party (for a review of this literature, see Groeling, 2013). A recent analysis of programming from cable television, talk radio, and political blogs found that ``efforts to provoke visceral responses (e.g., anger, righteousness, fear, moral indignation) from the audience though the use of overgeneralizations, sensationalism, misleading or partially inaccurate information, ad hominem attacks, and partial truths about opponents \\ldots'' occur regularly in the vast majority of programs examined \\citep[pg. 29][]{sobieraj2011incivility}.  Some previous work supports this conjecture. Studies that match voluntary exposure to partisan media with a predisposition for news programming find that (voluntary) exposure to partisan media polarizes \\citep{levendusky2013partisan}.\n\n\\subsection*{Measures}\n\\textbf{Preference for Soft News.} If a respondent selected a soft news story on any trial, we coded it as 1; hard news selections were coded 0. We next fitted these choices as a function of an underlying latent trait (preference for soft news) using a two-parameter item response model \\citep{lord1979biased}.  Letting $i$ index items (trials), $j$ index respondents, the model can be written as follows \n\n\\subsection*{Results}\n\n\n\\section*{Discussion}\nBoth the supply and the demand for partisan media are considerably greater today than a decade ago. These radical changes have naturally attracted a great deal of scholarly attention. Our study contributes to the burgeoning literature devoted to studying the political implications of changes in the media environment. To overcome familiar worries over the endogeneity of media consumption and political attitudes, scholars have tried to establish the causal effect of access to choice, exploiting idiosyncratic variation in the media menus of similar people. For instance, some studies have exploited idiosyncratic introduction of Fox News to estimate the impact of its introduction (not consumption) on voter preferences \\citep{DellaVigna2007,Hopkins2012}. Others have exploited the idiosyncratic location of various partisan channels on the television menu \\citep{Martin2014}. \n\nIn this paper, we exploited a similar strategy, although for a different medium. We used exogenous variation in access to broadband Internet (stemming from right-of-way laws), which significantly broadens access to content, to identify the impact of broadband access on partisan polarization \\citep[see also][]{Larcinese2012}. We found that access to broadband Internet polarizes rank-and-file partisans.\n\nAlthough we find that the introduction of broadband has contributed to the rise in affective polarization, we do not think broadband is the only, or perhaps even the primary, cause of the rise in partisan ill-will \\citep{Iyengar2012}. Affective polarization began to increase at least two decades before widespread Internet use. Instead, our claim is that the new media environment exacerbates already rising tensions. The data suggest that access to broadband Internet heightens partisan animus by increasing partisans' exposure to imbalanced partisan rhetoric.  \n\nWhile some scholars have concluded -- on the basis of data showing that exposure to partisan news is low and partisan imbalance small \\citep[for a review, see,][]{Prior2012} -- that partisan media cannot have a consequential impact, we think this verdict is too hasty, and pays too little attention to countervailing  evidence. For instance, \\citet{DellaVigna2007}, \\citet{Hopkins2012}, \\citet{Martin2014}, \\citet{levendusky2013partisan}, all find that minor changes to a large menu of choices have a substantively significant impact on preferences and attitudes. \n\nThere are a variety of potential reasons for why small doses of exposure to partisan media can add up to meaningful effects. For one, just because exposure is `small' doesn't necessarily mean that it is inconsequential. \\citet{Martin2014}, for instance, estimate that watching 4 minutes of Fox News a week is enough to increase the odds of voting for a Republican presidential candidate by .9 percent.  Second, as we noted at the outset, a small partisan imbalance in media exposure, on the order of magnitude found in \\citet{Gentzkow2011b}, \\citet{Dvir-Gvirsman2014} and \\citet{Flaxman2013}, when accumulated over long spans of time, is yet more liable to have substantial effects. \n\nFinally, it may well be that the preferences for agreeable partisan content are stronger than what previous research has suggested. Many of the studies investigating selective exposure code media content and consumption at the level of media outlets. This can understate preferences for partisan content. Prominent media outlets often categorized as ``moderate'' or ``non-partisan'', e.g. the New York Times, the Washington Post, etc., carry ideological content, except that those newspapers carry a wide array of voices \\citep{barbera2014}. Secondly, pooling across various kinds of news stories may understate the strength of preferences for partisan congenial content. For instance, using passively observed data from 1.2 million users (2.3 billion page views), \\citet{Flaxman2013} find that ideological segregation tends to be much smaller for general news stories than for opinion stories. All told, the extant literature may greatly understate the degree of imbalance in consumers' exposure to congenial over uncongenial information.\n\nRegardless of the strength of preferences, the fact that greater access to choice causes partisan animus fits well with the evidence from some other studies. In many ways the fact that access to broadband Internet causes polarization complements the finding that the introduction of broadcast television reduced polarization \\citep{campante2013}. As people's political information environment became `nonpartisan', as a result of the introduction of national network news, partisans' attitudes moderated. Today, as a result of greater access to partisan news, partisan animus has increased. \n\nIn closing, this study shows that the new media environment has contributed to increased partisan animus and that greater exposure to biased news sources is the likely cause.  As Americans gain more access to providers of partisan information, we can anticipate only more ``fear and loathing'' across party lines. \n\n%===================References=====================\n\\newpage\n\\bibliographystyle{apsr}\n\\bibliography{library}\n\n\\clearpage\n\\section*{Appendix A: XXX}\n\\renewcommand\\thetable{A\\arabic{table}}\n\\renewcommand\\thefigure{A\\arabic{figure}}\n\\setcounter{table}{0}\n\\setcounter{figure}{0}\n\n\n%===================End Document===================\n\\end{document}\n",
