    "contents" : "## Problem Set 1\n### Due Wednesday, September 9, 2015, 23:59\n\nFor now, copy and paste your commands and results (including figures) into a word document.\n\n1. Suppose you track your commute times for two weeks (10 days) and you find the following times in minutes: 17 16 20 24 22 15 21 15 17 22\n\t\n\t* Use the function max to find the longest commute time, the function mean to find the average and the function min to find the minimum.\n\t* Oops, the 24 was a mistake. It should have been 18. How can you fix this without rewriting the vector? Do so, and then find the new average.\n\t* How many times was your commute 20 minutes or more? Hint: try using sum() and a logical statement. [Read here about logical operators](http://www.statmethods.net/management/operators.html)\n\t* What percent of your commutes are less than 17 minutes? \n\t* Replace the 5th element of the vector with NA. Calculate the new mean. \n\n2. The Crimean War\n\t\n\t* Install the HistData package and load Nightingale. Read about it [here](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/HistData/Nightingale.html)\n\t* How many people died of Wounds? How many people died of Disease?\n\t* Create a piechart using the pie() command. You should have a slice for # of ppl dying of wounds, # of ppl dying of disease, # of ppl dying of other. Make sure to label all the slices. Give your graph a title. If you wish, change the colors. \n\t\t\n3. Loading data into R\n\t* We didn't get to this in class, but loading data into R will be central to your life as a data analysist. \n\t* Download the following files into your working directory (hint: use getwd())\n\t\t* If you want to make it more challenging, read it directly from the web (without downloading it to your working directory).  \n\t\t* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ylelkes/R_wav/master/data%20examples/Countries-Europe.csv\n\t\t* https://github.com/ylelkes/R_wav/blob/master/data%20examples/child_data.sav?raw=true\n\t\t* https://github.com/ylelkes/R_wav/blob/master/data%20examples/GaltonFamilies.dta?raw=true\n\t* Using read.csv, the foreign package, or haven load each one of these datasets into R.\n\t* For: \"Countries-Europe.csv\" (let's call that object europe)\n\t\t* What is the median population of Europe?\n\t\t* What is the mean population/land area\n\t\t* If you replace X and Y in the following, you will get most populated country in Europe:\n\t\t\t``` \n\t\t\teurope$X[europe$Y==max(europe$population)]\n\t\t\t```\n\t\t* What variable is X? What variable is Y?\n\t\t* In your own words, describe what this command is doing..\n\t* For GaltonFamilies.dta:\n\t\t* using the cor() command, what is the correlation between a child's height and his mother's height and what is the correlation between the child's height and the father's height? \n\t\t* Use a logical statement, get R to confirm that the first correlation does not equal the second correlation.\n\t\t* Using lm(), is there a relationship between the father's height and the number of children he has?\n\t\n\t* For child_data.sav\n\t\t* What is the memory span of child with the highest IQ?\n\t\t* Create a correlation table for the entire dataset\n\t\t* From the correlation table, extract the correlation between memory span & IQ, the correlation between age and reading ability, and the correlation between IQ and reading ability into a vector\n\t\t* write that vector to a csv file.\n\t\n\n",
