This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r,echo=F,results='asis'}
library(xtable)
options(xtable.comment = FALSE)
data(ToothGrowth)
ToothGrowth$len
print(xtable(prop.table(table(mtcars$cyl,mtcars$gear),2),caption="gears"),caption.placement = "top")

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
