1. Who you are.
2. What you did this summer.
3. What experience, if any, you have with data analysis, programming languages, etc.

## What is this course about?
1. Getting
2. Cleaning
3. and Presenting data. 
all within R.

## Data Munging/Wrangling

---
## 
Data scientists, according to interviews and expert estimates, spend from 50 percent to 80 percent of their time mired in this more mundane labor of collecting and preparing unruly digital data, before it can be explored for useful nuggets

library(dplyr)
iris %>% group_by(Species) %>% summarise(m=mean(Petal.Length),sd=sd(Petal.Length),n=length(Petal.Length))
```

## Error-Free Publication Quality Tables
```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE,results='hide',tidy=TRUE}
m1 <-lm(mpg ~ hp, data=mtcars)
m2 <-lm(mpg ~ hp+drat, data=mtcars)
m3 <- lm(mpg ~ hp+ drat + factor(gear), data= mtcars)
htmlreg(list(m1, m2, m3),custom.coef.names =c("Intercept","Gross horsepower","Rear axle ratio","Four foward gears", "Five forward  gears"))

```



---
```{r,echo=F,results='asis',message=F,comment=F,out.height=400}
library(texreg)
m1 <-lm(mpg ~ hp, data=mtcars)
m2 <-lm(mpg ~ hp+drat, data=mtcars)
m3 <- lm(mpg ~ hp+ drat + factor(gear), data= mtcars)
htmlreg(list(m1, m2, m3),custom.coef.names =c("Intercept","Gross horsepower","Rear axle  ratio","Four foward gears", "Five forward  gears"),doctype = F)
```

---
## Error-Free Documents
```
The effect of horsepower on MPG is \Sexpr{round(m1$coefficients[2],2)}.
```

The effect of horsepower on MPG is `r round(m1$coefficients[2],2)`

## Readings
* Journal articles related to ideas will be posted shortly
* More concerned that you practice the ideas than read about them
* Lots of books out there. You can buy them, but I think you can get by just fine without them. 
  * R Cookbook by Teetor
  * R for Everyone  by Lander
  * ggplot2 by Wickham


---
## Grades and formalities
* Weekly problem sets (will be assigned by Friday and due by Wednesday) 30 percent
* Final project 
  * Apply tools to a dataset of your choosing, need to include visualization and tables in a publication quality 
document. Github repository and interactive graphic. More details to come. 60 percent
  * 5 minute presentation in slidify or beamer, 10 percent 

---
## What is R?
* A programming language designed for statistical applications
* A statistical environment for data analysis

---
## Why do we like R so much?
* It’s free and open-source
* It’s cross-platform — the same code will produce the same results on
Windows, Mac, or Linux
* It’s easy to use and to program with
* It’s regularly updated — there’s a new major version roughly every year,
with intermediate revisions every 4–5 months
* It’s becoming the lingua franca of serious empirical work in the social sciences
* It’s already the lingua franca of applied statistics

## Installing R (on Windows)
1. Open http://www.r-project.org/ in your browser.
2. Click on “CRAN”. You’ll see a list of mirror sites, organized by country.
3. Select a site near you.
4. Click on “Windows” under “Download and Install R”.
5. Click on “base”.
6. Click on the link for downloading the latest version of R (an .exe file).
7. When the download completes, double-click on the .exe file and answer the
usual questions.

---
## Installing R (on OS X)
1. Open http://www.r-project.org/ in your browser.
2. Click on “CRAN”. You’ll see a list of mirror sites, organized by country.
3. Select a site near you.
4. Click on “MacOS X”.
5. Click on the .pkg file for the latest version of R, under “Files:”, to download it.
6. When the download completes, double-click on the .pkg file and answer the
usual questions.

## Using the command line


---
## RStudio
* Integrated Development Environment
* Other IDEs out there
* Can use datajoy, eclipse, emacs


---
## Install RStudio

---
## Installing development versions of packages
```{r,eval=F}
install.packages("arm")
```


---
## Installing development versions of packages
```{r,eval=F}
require(devtools)
install_github(repo="coefplot",username="jaredlander")
```

---
## Loading packages
```{r,eval=F}
require(coefplot)
library(coefplot)
```

---
## Sometimes we don't want to call up the package into memory
Try the following.
```{r,eval=F}
m3 <- lm(mpg ~ hp+ drat + factor(gear), data= mtcars)
install coefplot
library(coefplot)
coefplot(m3)
install arm
library(arm)
coefplot(m3)
coefplot::coefplot(m3)
arm::coefplot(m3)
```

---
## Sometimes we don't want to call up the package into memory
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(plyr)
```
