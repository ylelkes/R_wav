## Matrices
* matrices are indexed by x and y coordinates [x,y]
* Indexing matrices: 
  * mtcars
  * What value is in the 6th row, 2nd column of mtcars?

## Download the following to your working directory
* Download the following to your working directory (http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/mtrush1.pgm) (hint getwd())


```
library(pixmap)
mtrush2 <- read.pnm("mtrush1.pgm")
mtrush2
str(mtrush2)
plot(mtrush2)
mtrush2@grey
dim(mtrush2@grey)
mtrush2@grey[84:163,135:177]
mtrush2@grey[,104:164]=0
plot(mtrush2)

<- 1
plot(mtrush2)
mtrush2@grey[84:163,135:177] <- 0
plot(mtrush2)
```

## data.frames
* Type of class you'll (probably) use most
* Like a matrix, but each column can be any type of class

```
x <- 10:1
y <- -4:5
first10letters <- letters[1:10] 
df <- data.frame(x,y,first10letters)
```

* Columns have to be the same length
```
first11letters <- letters[1:11] 
data.frame(x,y,first11letters)
```

---
## The object names are the column names

```
names(df)
athroughj <- letters[1:10] 
df <- data.frame(x,y,athroughj)
names(df)
names(df) <- c("a1","a2","column3")
names(df)
```

---
## Learning about your data.frame

```
nrow(df)
ncol(df)
dim(df)
names(df)[3]
head(df)
tail(df)
df[1:3,3]
class(df[,3])
class(df[,1])
df$column3
df$ 
```

```
## Subsetting your data
newdf <- subset(df,x==1)
newdf <- df[df$x==1,]
```

```
## With the Titanic dataset in datasets package
* Using subset, what was the mean age of children?
* Using indices to filter, what was the mean age of adults?
* Using table(): what percentage on board were 1st class, 2nd class, and 3rd class passengers
* Adding an additional variable and the prop.table command,what percentage of 1st class, 2nd class, 3rd class?
* Using a $\chi^2$ test, was the survival rate significantly different between men and women?

## Lists

rf <- list(mtcars,letters)
list[[3]]



---
## Download the following to your working directory
* Download the following to your working directory (http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/mtrush1.pgm) (hint getwd())
* Inside mtrush2 is a matrix that is [y,x] dimensions (note, for whatever reason the matrix is flipped)
library("ggmap")
library("mapproj")
map <- get_map(location = 'Europe', zoom = 4)
ggmap(map)
```
library(pixmap)
mtrush2 <- read.pnm("mtrush1.pgm")
```



```{r}
img3 <- readJPEG("data examples/The_Nightwatch_by_Rembrandt.jpg")
titanic <- read.csv("data examples/titanic3.csv")
prop.table(table(titanic$pclass,titanic$survived),1)
```

## R base graphics
```
hist(mtcars$mpg)
plot(mtcars$mpg~mtcars$hp)
boxplot(mtcars$mpg,mtcars$cyl)
```

---
## R base graphics
* Generally ugly
* Enter Hadley Wickham
* ![Hadley Wickham](http://www.statistics.rice.edu/uploadedImages/Faculty/hadley-rice%201.JPG)
* ggplot2: The grammar of graphics
* Easy to start with, but you can end up with complex figures. 
* Today will do part 1. In a few weeks we'll do part.

## ggplot2

```
install.packages(ggplot2)
```

### Every ggplot2 object has three components
1. data,

2. A set of aesthetic mappings between variables in the data and visual properties, and

3. At least one geom, geometric object, which describes how to render each observation.

```
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +geom_point()
```

---
## Exercises (1)
1. What is this showing? 
```
ggplot(mpg, aes(model, manufacturer)) + geom_point() 
```
2. Can you make it more informative?

3. Describe the data, aesthetic mappings and layers used for each of the following plots. See if you can predict what the plot will look like before running the code.

```
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) + geom_point()
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_point()
ggplot(economics, aes(date, unemploy)) + geom_line()
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty)) + geom_histogram()
```

---
## Aesthetics

```
aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)
aes(displ, hwy, shape = drv)
aes(displ, hwy, size = cyl)
```

```
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, cty)) + 
  geom_point()
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, cty, colour = class)) + 
  geom_point()
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, cty, colour = class)) +  geom_point(color="blue")
```

---
## Exercises
1. Experiment with the colour, shape and size aesthetics. What happens when you map them to continuous values? What about categorical values? 

2. What happens when you use more than one aesthetic in a plot?

3. What happens if you map a continuous variable to shape? Why? What happens if you map trans to shape? Why?
